For running the project cd into the final project
directory and use the following command line syntax:

python pokemon.py [option]

where [option] is one of either:
basic
intermediate
advanced

These are the sample runthroughs I've included in my
project. Basic is a simple run, in which player 1 wins easily,
advanced is one in which player one wins in more difficult 
fashion, and intermediate was used mainly for testing purposes.
